# Hi there, I'm Roberta 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Ph.D. Student based in Bologna, Italy. I have a passion for developing advanced selection algorithms that optimize decision-making processes and evaluating environmental and climate policies through a **local lens**. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing algorithmic efficiency and exploring innovative applications in real-world scenarios, particularly within environmental policy evaluation.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Selection Algorithm** project aimed at improving data-driven decision-making and **Policy Evaluation** for environmental and climate initiatives.
- 🌱 I’m learning **Machine Learning** and **Environmental Policy Analysis**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving **data analysis**, **AI-driven applications**, and **environmental economics**.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **scaling algorithms for large datasets** and **measuring the impact of climate policies**.
- 💬 Ask me about **algorithm design** and **environmental policy evaluation**.
